# Active Admin Jobs

It's a Rails engine that allows you to play nice with [Active Job](https://github.com/rails/activejob) in [Active Admin](https://github.com/activeadmin/activeadmin) providing user feedback. It uses [Job Notifier](https://github.com/platanus/job_notifier) gem and includes:

- An endpoint to a view with a jobs list.
- A DSL that allows you to catch a `JobNotifier::Job` instance `response` to build success/error HTML views.
- The mechanism to listen job status changes and notify them.
